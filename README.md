# CrewAI Multi-Phase Workshop

A hands-on journey to master multi-agent AI workflows with CrewAI, progressing from basics to advanced RAG, file tools, API automation, Flows, and more.

---

## 🧭 What’s Inside

- **phases/** — Each phase builds new CrewAI skills (from “Hello CrewAI” to advanced workflows).
- **outputs/** — Files generated by agents (e.g., markdown, code, etc).
- **.env.example** — Template for required API keys/secrets.
- **requirements.txt** — Project dependencies.
- **.gitignore** — Secure, ignores venv, .env, and build files.

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Create a Python virtual environment**
```
python -m venv venv     # Create environemnt
venv/Scripts/Activate   # Activate it
```
3. **Install requirements:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
4. **Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys.**
- **Never** share your real `.env`!
- You need API keys for OpenAI and Serper (Google Search). More keys may be needed in future phases.
